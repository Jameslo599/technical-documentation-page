This is a JavaScript documentation page that I developed mobile first. This project was the most challenging yet, but also the one where I learned a great deal. This was my first time developing mobile first, using devtools on Chrome and really understanding how to use media queries. Going forward, I definitely will choose to develop mobile-first as I find it much easier to code for desktop responsiveness rather than coding from desktop to mobile. I am proud of this work!
